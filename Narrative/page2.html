	“If the lion keeps this up, none of us will be left in the forest," said the bear. 

	“He kills much more than he really needs to," squeaked the little hare. 

	“We have to come up with something to stop this massacre," said the monkey. So they all joined together and went to meet the lion. </center></p>

	<p><center><p style="font-size: 140%;">
	“O king of the forest, we have come to make a small request," they all said to the lion. </p></center>


	<p><center><p style="font-size: 140%;">“Now what would that be?" asked the amused lion. </p></center>

	<p><center><p style="font-size: 140%;">“You are the king of the forest, but soon there will be no animals to rule over. So we beg you to stop this unreasonable killing and we promise that one of us will come to you everyday for your food," pleaded all the animals with the lion.</p></center>
